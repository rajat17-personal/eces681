Homework: Creating a 3D Stereo Image from Two Images Without Camera Intrinsic
Parameters
Objective
In this assignment, you will generate a stereo 3D image using two images taken from different
viewpoints. Since camera intrinsic parameters are unknown, you will estimate depth
using uncalibrated stereo rectification and disparity computation.
